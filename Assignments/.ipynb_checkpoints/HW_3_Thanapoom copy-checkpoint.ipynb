       "{'text': 'In 1995, Coolio made a song featuring R&B singer LV for the movie Dangerous Minds, titled \"Gangsta\\'s Paradise\". It would become one of the most successful rap songs of all time, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 3 weeks. It was the #1 single of 1995 for all genres, and was a global hit, as it reached #1 in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand. The song also created a controversy when Coolio claimed that parody artist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic had not asked for permission to make his parody of \"Gangsta\\'s Paradise\", titled \"Amish Paradise\". At the 1996 Grammy Awards, the song won Coolio a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance.  Originally \"Gangsta\\'s Paradise\" was not meant to be included on one of Coolio\\'s studio albums, but its success led to Coolio not only putting it on his next album but also making it the title track. The title track sampled the chorus and music of the song \"Pastime Paradise\" by Stevie Wonder, which was recorded nearly 20 years earlier on Stevie Wonder\\'s album Songs in the Key of Life. The album Gangsta\\'s Paradise was released in 1995 and was certified 2X Platinum by the RIAA. The album contained two other major hits in \"1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin\\' New)\" and \"Too Hot\" with J.T. Taylor of Kool & the Gang doing the chorus. Despite no longer being an official member of the group, Coolio made an appearance on the second WC and the Maad Circle album Curb Servin\\', on the song \"In a Twist\". In 1996, Coolio had another top 40 hit with the song \"It\\'s All the Way Live (Now)\" from the soundtrack to the movie Eddie. He was also featured on the song \"Hit \\'em High\" from the soundtrack to the movie Space Jam with B-Real, Method Man, LL Cool J, and Busta Rhymes.  In 2014, the band Falling in Reverse did a cover of \"Gangster\\'s Paradise\" for \"Punk Goes 90\\'s\", with Coolio making a cameo in the music video. ',\n",

It was the #1 single of 1995 for all genres, and was a global hit, as it reached #1 in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand. The song also created a controversy when Coolio claimed that parody artist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic had not asked for permission to make his parody of \"Gangsta\\'s Paradise\", titled \"Amish Paradise\". At the 1996 Grammy Awards, the song won Coolio a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance.  Originally \"Gangsta\\'s Paradise\" was not meant to be included on one of Coolio\\'s studio albums, but its success led to Coolio not only putting it on his next album but also making it the title track. The title track sampled the chorus and music of the song \"Pastime Paradise\" by Stevie Wonder, which was recorded nearly 20 years earlier on Stevie Wonder\\'s album Songs in the Key of Life. The album Gangsta\\'s Paradise was released in 1995 and was certified 2X Platinum by the RIAA. The album contained two other major hits in \"1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin\\' New)\" and \"Too Hot\" with J.T. Taylor of Kool & the Gang doing the chorus. Despite no longer being an official member of the group, Coolio made an appearance on the second WC and the Maad Circle album Curb Servin\\', on the song \"In a Twist\". In 1996, Coolio had another top 40 hit with the song \"It\\'s All the Way Live (Now)\" from the soundtrack to the movie Eddie. He was also featured on the song \"Hit \\'em High\" from the soundtrack to the movie Space Jam with B-Real, Method Man, LL Cool J, and Busta Rhymes.  In 2014, the band Falling in Reverse did a cover of \"Gangster\\'s Paradise\" for \"Punk Goes 90\\'s\", with Coolio making a cameo in the music video. '"
